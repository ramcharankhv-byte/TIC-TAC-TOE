## 🧠 What I Learned

While building this project, I understood and applied:
- **DOM manipulation** using JavaScript  
- **Event handling** (click events for game boxes and buttons)  
- **Game logic implementation**  
- **Dynamic UI updates**  
- **Responsive layout** using CSS Flexbox and media queries  

> Although I took guidance and inspiration from **Apna College**, I made sure to **understand every concept and logic** before implementing it.  
> My goal was to improve both my **frontend logic-building** and **CSS design** skills.
